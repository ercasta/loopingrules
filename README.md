# LoopingRules

**An entity-component world, a loop that runs rules over it, and one
thread to run a session on.**

An *entity* is an identity with no data — `#7`. A *component* is data
with no identity — `Size(bytes=4300)`. A *rule* is a Python function of
one `World` that asks for the entities carrying a set of components,
walks them, and WRITES to it directly — `spawn`/`attach`/`replace`/
`detach`/`remove`/`destroy`. The *loop* calls every rule, once a tick,
over and over, until a whole pass changes nothing, and that is when the
world has something to say. The *engine* is one thread that owns that
loop and routes what it says to however many channels are attached to it.

## Try it

```bash
pip install -e .
python3 -c "
from loopingrules import Loop
from loopingrules.world import Reply, Said

loop = Loop()

@loop.rule
def greet(w):
    for e, said in w.each(Said):
        w.destroy(e)
        w.spawn(Reply('user', 'hi, %s' % said.text))

loop.world.spawn(Said('user', 'world'))
loop.run()
for e, r in loop.world.each(Reply):
    print(r.text)
"
```

## Scope

**No domain, no channel, no transport.** `world.py`, `loop.py`,
`engine.py` and `save.py` ship no rules, no components
beyond `Said` and `Reply` (the shapes `Engine.drain` and `Engine._do`
route by), and no knowledge of files, sockets, or terminals. `Engine`
wants anything with `.name`, `.deliver(message)`, and optionally
`.start(engine)` / `.close()` — no base class, no import required to be
one.

**And no vocabulary above entities and components either, any more.**
This package used to also ship `facts.py`/`arbitration.py` — a
`fact`/`state`/`deny` way of writing relations as components, and a
generic reader arbitrating between rules proposing/vetoing/ranking
candidates for one contested decision. Removed, not ported, once the
core above was rewritten — see History, "Facts/arbitration/request
removed." `DECISION_PATTERNS.md` keeps the argument for why a generic
arbitration reader beats agency in the base rule (extracted from
`pystrider`, a domain that measured the alternative's cost first: two
repair rules firing on one bug, "correct by luck"); it just is not code
in this package any more. A domain that wants that pattern writes its
own components and its own generic reader over them, the way
`harneskills.examples.fs` already writes everything else it needs.

**`harneskills`, a sibling repo, is the worked door onto it** — a
`Terminal` channel, a WebSocket `Listener` and `client`, a config-file
format for naming domains, and `harneskills.examples.fs`, a domain built
on `World` and `Loop` alone. None of that is imported here; this package
does not know `harneskills` exists, and does not know where its checkout
lives on disk.

## History

**loopingrules, 2026-08-29 (afternoon).** Carved out of `harneskills`'s
`./engine` into this, its own repo, and renamed from `ugm` to
`loopingrules` on the way out -- the third name this package has carried
(see "This is `ugm` a second time," below, for the second). A mechanical
rename throughout -- `ugm.world` → `loopingrules.world`, the private
`_ugm_watches`/`_ugm_priority` function attributes → `_loopingrules_
watches`/`_loopingrules_priority`, the package's own `__init__.py`
dropped the "Universal Graph Machine" acronym it no longer answers to --
with ONE deliberate exception: every History entry below this one is left
exactly as it was written, `ugm` and all, because it is an accurate record
of what this package was called at the time each entry happened, not a
description of what it is called now. `harneskills` depends on this
package by name (`loopingrules`) the same way it used to depend on `ugm`
-- nothing about `World`/`Loop`/`Engine`/`save` changed shape, only where
they are imported from.

**Facts/arbitration/request removed, 2026-08-29 (afternoon).** `facts.py`,
`arbitration.py` and `request.py` -- ON HOLD since the core rewrite below
left them unable to import -- are deleted outright, along with their
tests. Nothing in this repository ever imported any of the three
(`harneskills.examples.fs` writes its own components throughout), and
there was no third path between "port them" and "delete them" left worth
keeping open: the standing argument for a generic arbitration reader
(`DECISION_PATTERNS.md`, kept) does not need the CODE to survive, only
a domain that wants it to reach for the pattern by hand.

**Deltas removed, 2026-08-29 (midday).** A rule calls `world.spawn`/
`attach`/`replace`/`detach`/`remove`/`destroy` directly again, the same
as `install()` always did — see "Deltas, 2026-08-27" below for what this
undoes. The guarantee deltas bought (a rule that forgot the contract and
touched the world anyway got caught, named, on `loop.errors`) had already
stopped holding in practice: three rules in `harneskills`'s own test suite
called `w.spawn`/`w.destroy` directly, `loop.errors` recorded the
violation every tick, and the suite stayed green throughout because
nothing asserted it was empty. The other half of the argument for
removing it: a "proposed" action that matters to a domain is better
modelled as an explicit component sitting in the world for another rule
to query (`fs.py`'s `RenameWish` + `NeedsApproval` already does exactly
this) than as a second, lower-level notion of "not yet real" underneath
every write, including the ones no domain ever treats as provisional at
all. `ugm.delta` — `Pending`, the six delta classes, the two `_resolve_*`
functions — is deleted outright, not deprecated; `Loop.tick` is
correspondingly a few lines shorter, with nothing left to apply after
calling a rule and nothing left to check for a rule having "cheated."

**Rules, not systems, 2026-08-29 (late morning).** `Loop.system`/
`Facts.system` → `Loop.rule`/`Facts.rule`, `self.systems` → `self.rules`,
the `/systems` REPL command → `/rules`, `fs.py`'s `SYSTEMS` tuple →
`RULES`, and every docstring, comment, and README that said "a system is
a function that..." now says "a rule." "Filesystem," `SystemExit`,
`systemd`, and TOML's own `[build-system]` table name are the same words
for something else entirely and stayed put.

**Priority ordering, 2026-08-29 (mid-morning).** `Loop.rule(fn,
priority=N)` -- higher runs first, ties (the default, `0`, included) keep
registration order. The one deliberate override of "registration order
is the whole of arbitration": two rules `watches`-ing the same component
type, installed by two domains that do not know about each other and so
cannot agree on which one to register first. A rule is still one entry
in `self.rules` regardless of how many types it watches, so declaring
`priority` changes WHEN it runs, never how many times.

**A core rewrite and a request/response protocol, 2026-08-29 (morning).**
Two changes landed in one commit, because the second turned out to
depend on the first: `world.py`'s storage moved to plain
`@dataclasses.dataclass` components (no more `Component` base class),
several per entity (`attach` appends and dedupes, `replace`/`remove`
join `detach` for the singular and one-value cases, `get_all`/`all` read
the plural one), and primitives-only fields (a reference to another
entity is its plain id, never a live handle -- `World.attach` enforces
this on the way in). `ugm.save` became JSONL, version 2, dropping the
`{"$entity": ...}` wrapper a plain int no longer needs.

Built the same day on top of it: `request.py` extracted the other
pattern `docs/overview.md` had been asking for since before this
package's own split -- a rule deposits a request (a `details` entity,
characterized by ordinary facts and listed in one row of `request(hub,
details)`), any number of responders `respond`/`complete` on it without
knowing about each other or the asker, and one generic `watch()` retires
it -- `fulfilled` once every responder that started has finished,
`timed_out` if a tick budget (widened by a responder's own `extend()`)
runs out first. It was `arbitration.commit`'s counterpart for a
different shape of question ("did everyone answer" rather than "who
won"), and the one place either module fired on a clock rather than a
change: ageing the counter *is* the observable a silent, hung, or simply
absent responder needs someone to notice. `Loop.rule`'s `watches=` --
skip calling a rule's body entirely on a tick where none of its declared
component types exist yet -- landed alongside it, for the same reason:
a request nobody is answering still has to be checked on, every tick,
without every OTHER rule in a large ruleset paying for that.

This is `ugm` a second time. The first `universal-graph-machine` was a
graph substrate `harneskills` was a terminal onto — a corpus format, a
loader, attention and arbitration over a graph of facts. That dependency
was dropped and replaced with `loop.py`: a rule is a Python function
of one `World`, not a rule matched against a graph, and the loop calls
every one of them in registration order until a pass changes nothing.
This package is that replacement, carved back out once `harneskills`'s
own split between "the engine" and "the doors onto it" had already drawn
the line the old dependency used to sit on.

**A vocabulary, 2026-08-28.** `facts.py` and `arbitration.py` arrived from
`pystrider`, which had carried them since it was rewritten onto this world.
`facts.py` lost the one thing that was about living in another checkout —
`_NEEDS`, a set of `ugm` names asserted on import so that drift failed by
name rather than three frames into a run. It versions with `world.py` now,
so there is no gap left to assert across.

**A world of facts survives a restart, 2026-08-28.** It did not before, and
it failed quietly, which is the worst way. `save` resolves a component by
`module:ClassName` with `getattr`; `relation()` MAKES its classes with
`type()`; so every relation in a saved world came back as one named problem
and a dropped component, and a relation whose name collided with something
`ugm.facts` imports (`spawn`, `attach`) raised `TypeError` out of `load` and
cost the session rather than the component. A class may now say how to name
itself — `Relation` answers `ugm.facts:relation(for_stmt)`, and the trailing
call is resolved by calling it. ⭐ The second half was that interning lived
in `Facts._words`, a dict beside the world: restoring the components alone
would have given you a fact pointing at one `Printed("loop")` and every new
rule asking for another. Which entity is THE one for its text is a component
now (`Interned`), so it comes back too, and `_words` is a cache of the world
rather than the truth about it.

**Deltas, 2026-08-27.** A rule stopped being allowed to touch a world
at all. It used to call `world.spawn`/`attach`/`detach`/`destroy`
directly, applied and visible the moment it did; now it RETURNS a list
of `ugm.delta` values describing what should happen, and `Loop.tick` is
the only thing that ever calls those four methods, right after a rule
returns, before the next one runs -- so a later rule in the same tick
still sees an earlier one's own effect, the same as direct mutation
always let it. `tick()` checks this rather than trusting it: a rule
whose own code moved `world.revision` is a named, loud error on
`loop.errors`, not a silent bypass. The one real wrinkle was a `spawn`
a rule wants to use again before its own turn ends -- attach more to
it, embed it in another component's field -- solved by handing back a
`Pending` from `spawn()` that resolves to the real entity the moment its
`Spawn` is applied, walking every later delta in the same list and every
field of every component in it for the same token (`_resolve_component`,
built the way `ugm.save` already rebuilds a component off disk, without
its `__init__`).
