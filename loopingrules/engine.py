"""The thing that runs: one world, one thread, and any number of channels.

    engine = Engine(loop)
    engine.attach(repl.Terminal())          # the tmux session
    engine.attach(serve.Listener(...))      # and every WebSocket client
    engine.run()

A CHANNEL is anything that can hand this engine lines and be handed
messages back. A terminal is one. Each WebSocket connection is one. They
are attached to a running engine, several at a time, and none of them own
it -- which is the whole point of this module existing: before it, the
prompt owned the loop and the server owned the loop, so you had to pick
one at startup and the other could never see that world.

## One thread owns the world

Channels are threads -- reading a socket, reading a keyboard. They never
touch the world. They `post()` onto a queue, and the engine's own thread
takes one, spawns a `Said`, settles the loop, and routes what came out.
So there is no lock around the world, no reentrancy, and a tick means the
same thing on every channel.

It also means nothing a rule does may BLOCK. A rule that stopped to
`input()` an approval would stop the world for every other channel, and
would be reading a keyboard the terminal channel is already reading. That
is why `fs.approve` asks by spawning a `Reply` and waiting for a `yes` --
the suspended state was already a component.

## What a channel is

Four things, and no base class to inherit -- this is the whole contract::

    channel.name              a str, unique; the engine sets it if unset
    channel.start(engine)     called on attach. Start your threads here.
    channel.deliver(message)  a dict, from this engine's thread.
    channel.close()           called on detach or shutdown.

`deliver` is called from the engine's thread and should not block for
long; a socket channel writes and moves on, and drops itself if the write
fails.

## What a message is

The same shapes on the way out to everyone -- a terminal renders them as
prose, a socket serialises them as JSON::

    {"reply":   {"channel": "user", "text": "scan.pdf (4300 bytes)"}}
    {"unheard": {"text": "what is for dinner"}}
    {"error":   {"text": "fs.flag_big: KeyError: ..."}}
    {"lines":   ["#1  Session(...)", ...]}        a command's own output
    {"settled": {"revision": 412, "entities": 13}}
    {"world":   [{"version": 2, ...}, ...]}       `loopingrules.save.dump`'s own

...and four on the way in, which is what `post` takes: `say` (a line),
`command` (a slash command, run on this thread so it may read the world),
`get` (the world, for a client that renders state), and `stop` (end the
session). `stop` is a message and not a direct call for the same reason
the other three are: posted through the queue, it lands in order behind
whatever a channel said just before it, rather than racing the engine's
own thread to decide which happens first. A channel MAY still call
`engine.stop()` directly if it truly means "right now, whatever is
queued" -- `Server.serve`'s own shutdown does -- but `post(..., "stop")`
is what an ordinary `/quit` should reach for.

## Channels, and who hears what

`user` is not a channel, it is EVERYONE. A domain that says
`Reply("user", ...)` -- which the shipped `fs` domain does -- is heard by
the terminal and by every connected client at once, because that is what
a shared world means. A reply addressed to a channel's own name
(`term`, `ws2`) goes only there, which is how a domain answers just the
asker: carry the channel off the `Said` you consumed.
