"""What the state file promises: the same world, ids and all, next time.

⚠ The `__loopingrules_save__`/`module:factory(arg)` mechanism this file used
to test (a class minted by `loopingrules.facts.relation()` naming its own
factory so `save` could find it) is gone along with `facts.py` itself --
see this package's own `README.md`, "Facts/arbitration/request removed."
